            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Kaspian, and I've been a part of the furry community and virtual spaces for six years. Creating content, especially in VR, something I enjoy because it lets me express ideas in the form of skits and be goofy overall. I love experimenting with different angles, environments, and lighting to capture the perfect moments, whether for photos or videos.</p>

            <p>When I'm not in VR, I focus on my studies as a computer science major, where I enjoy learning about technology and different programming languages. Although my studies and creative projects don't directly overlap, each offers me unique ways to express myself. The sense of connection I feel in both areas motivates me to keep exploring and trying new things.</p>

            <p>Outside of content creation, I'm a bit of a gamer and anime fan, and I'm always down to talk about Overwatch 2, Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer, or any other animes people recommend. In the future, I hope to dive deeper into streaming and maybe even collaborate with other creators. Thanks for getting to know me a little betterâ€”I'm excited to see where this creative journey takes me!</p>
